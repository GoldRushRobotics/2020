## How to use GitHub

#### Install Git
First thing's first, make sure you have git installed on your computer. If you don't have it installed, you can install it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

#### Clone the Repo
Next let's clone this repo. Open your command line, terminal, or bash and navigate to the directory in which you want to put all of the code.

Once you're in the directory you want the code to be in, simply type in:
```
git clone https://github.com/car-robotics/2020.git
```
You should now see a new folder in your current directory called `2020`.

Boom! You now have the most up to date code from the repo. You don't have to clone the repo everytime you want to get updates, however. 

#### Git Pull - Get most up to date code
To get the most up to date code, type in:
```
git pull
```
This will pull in the most up to date changes from the repo. It is a good idea to pull updates before you start coding and before you push your code up to the repo to make sure you are editing and pushing the most up to date stuff.

#### Staging Changes to be Committed
If you're ready to push your code, and you've already pulled to make sure you have the most up to date, you will first need to stage your changes. Simply running:
```
git add .
```
will stage all of your changes to be committed. This will show you all of the things that you have changed. 

#### Committing Changes
If everything looks right, it's time to commit. Run the command:
```
git commit -m "Your message here"
```
Add your message that briefly describes the changes you've made.

#### Pushing Changes
Now that you have committed, and there are no merge conflicts, you can push those committed changes up to the repo.
```
git push
```
Will push all committed changes.

#### Merge Conflicts
If you ever have merge conflicts, ask Matt for help unless you know for certain what you are doing.
